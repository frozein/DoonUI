# DoonUI
A simple UI library designed for use in video games, written in C++, with rendering code in C and OpenGL. Do note that this is a WIP hobby project, so it may lack polish or depth of features.

Some of the notable features include:
* SDF-based text rendering
* Many options for element positioning, allowing for layouts to play well with multiple window sizes
* A simple yet robust animation system
* Relative ease to add new elements types (only buttons and text are currently implemented)
